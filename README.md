# SolarPanel_vs_UVSensor
In this project, we have tried to prove a correlatin between the data collected through a UV sensor and a Solar Panel to propose a replace of UV sensors by the solar panels to make devcies self sustainable and cheap. We have collected data using a solar panel and UV sensor simultaneously for different conditions - visualized and compared the data.
